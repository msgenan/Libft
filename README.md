libft is a personal C library created as part of the curriculum at 42 School. The project aims to recreate common C library functions and implement essential utilities to deepen understanding of the C language,
particularly memory management, string manipulation, and other low-level operations. In this project, students write functions that are typically found in the C standard library (such as memset, strcpy, atoi, etc.) from scratch.
By doing so, students gain hands-on experience in how these functions work internally and how to manage memory effectively. The library consists of various functions that deal with memory allocation, string handling, and data structures, such as linked lists.
This project is essential for strengthening the fundamentals of C programming and is often considered one of the cornerstones of the 42 School's curriculum. The main goal of the project is to implement each function correctly and ensure they pass all the required tests.
Additionally, students are expected to manage memory efficiently and avoid memory leaks, which is crucial in C programming. By the end of this project, students are expected to have a solid understanding of how to write low-level code and manage memory manually.
